<h1>Using jQuery to duplicate a section of a form, maintaining accessibility</h1>
This plugin gives the user ability to clone a section of a form, as well as destroy a section. This also allows the user to add an empty form section with unique IDs, names, and labels to maintain accessibility and work with the database.
